    "Heart disease is the [leading cause](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) of death in the U.S. for men and women. The risk factors that increase a person's risk are: diabetes, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use. \n",

    "[Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) excerpted from CDC's health survey, the [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html). The dataset (n= 319,795) has 17 features which are survey responses; a mix of numeric, binary (yes/no, male, female), categorical (White, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Other, Hispanic) and  Likert scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent). Complete survey questions are available in the [BRFSS 2020 Data Dictionary](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2020/pdf/codebook20_llcp-v2-508.pdf). \n",

    "`Building a classification model in python is required, including trying at least several of the classification models covered during the course and using class imbalance techniques and feature engineering as appropriate. You should also spend extra time thinking about feature engineering. How can you come up with representations of the data that are really relevant to the business / the predictive problem, and demonstrate that the features you've engineered add predictive value?\n",
